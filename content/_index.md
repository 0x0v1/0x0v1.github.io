headless: true

Welcome to my site. On this site, you will find my publications, blog posts, media coverage and contact details. You can find out more about me on the about page. I believe that true hackers, those who are driven by the pursuit of justice, freedom and human rights - have the power to expose the vulnerabilities of oppressive systems and ignite a revolution of change. This is what I stand by.

If you have stayed this long, I encourage you to read [A Cypherpunk's Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html) (if you haven't already).
