Welcome to my site. On this website, you will find my publications, blog posts, media coverage and contact details.
You can find out more about me on the about page. 

I am Ovi, a hacker, cypherpunk and technologist. I run a activist group called SystemError and work for various NGO's doing security, privacy and computer science based research. My work centralises around exposing corporate injustices, attacks to citizens by hostile governments and decentralization. I stand by the values of the [Cypherpunk's Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html) in creating anonymous transaction systems, and protecting our right to privacy. I am curious and passionate about exploring human rights, privacy, open society, open-source, open-protocol and commons. 

I believe that hacking has the power to change the digital landscape for the people; true hackers, those who are driven by the pursuit of justice, freedom and human rights - have the power to expose the vulnerabilities of oppressive systems and ignite a revolution of change.
